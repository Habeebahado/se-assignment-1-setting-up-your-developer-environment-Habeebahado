Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
# My Setup

## Installing Windows
I already had Windows 11 on my PC so I didn’t have to install it.

## Installing VS Code
I installed VS Code with the help of the tutors on the live sessions. First I entered Visual Studio code download on my Chrome browser. Then I selected VS code for Windows and downloaded it. After downloading I installed it by following the setup guide for Windows, and added it to Path on Environment variables. I also installed extensions like prettier, python, and so on.

## Setting Up Git and GitHub
I followed the live session recording and had many problems configuring and setting my git and git bash. I downloaded Git for Windows on Google Chrome and installed it, I also added it to Path in environment variables. I had a problem configuring my user name and email as I was a newbie and it wasn’t displaying exactly what I saw from the live session. So I thought I got the setup wrong meanwhile I didn’t. The next live session I watched cleared that up. I struggled with the configurations and commands but I have gotten better with it currently.

## Installing Python and pip
I downloaded Python for Windows on my Google Chrome browser and then followed the installation guide from my browser and Python installation recorded session. After installing I added it to Path on Environment variables.

## Installing MySQL
Installing MySQL for me was kind of tricky and difficult. Basically I followed the step-by-step process from the live session.
